## Link-by-Link Decisions

### Link 1: ⚠️ MONITOR REQUIRED

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current Peak Capacity | 1.74 Gbps |
| Required Capacity (Optimized) | 0.25 Gbps |
| Capacity Reduction | 85.9% |
| Buffer Size | 143 µs |
| Risk Level | 🔴 HIGH |
| Current Link Rate | 10G |

> [!WARNING]
> **Recommendation:** Deploy shaping with close monitoring.
> Address identified risk factors before full deployment.

**Next Steps:**
1. Deploy shaping in monitoring mode first
2. Address failure modes from resilience analysis
3. Prepare upgrade plan as fallback
