O-RAN FRONTHAUL OPTIMIZER - 2-MINUTE PRESENTATION SCRIPT
================================================================

[SECTION 1 - 30s]
"This cell's average load is under 0.5 Gbps, but micro-bursts spike to 30+ Gbps.
Fronthaul congestion is caused by micro-bursts, not sustained traffic."

[SECTION 2 - 30s]
"We used correlation analysis to discover topology. These cells burst together
because they share the same link. Pure data-driven discovery, no network map needed."

[SECTION 3 - 45s]
"Traditional solution: upgrade to 32 Gbps. Our solution: software shaping with
143 µs buffer reduces requirement to 3.7 Gbps. That's 88.5% capacity reduction.
No hardware upgrade needed."

[SECTION 4 - 30s]
"For each link, we provide clear decisions supported by AI explanations. Link 2: DO NOT UPGRADE. 
Enable shaping, save $12,000, reduce energy by 90 kWh/year. Clear actions, not just data."

[SECTION 5 - 30s]
"Is it safe? Wide operating range from 100-200 µs. Packet loss stays under 1%.
Robust, tunable, production-ready."

[CLOSING - 15s]
"88% capacity reduction. Deterministic and explainable. Ready for deployment.
