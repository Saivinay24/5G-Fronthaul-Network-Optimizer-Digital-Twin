Explanation:
The deterministic analysis shows Link 2 can operate safely at reduced capacity with traffic shaping enabled. The configuration requires a 143 microsecond buffer at the DU/switch layer. Expected impact: 90.7% capacity reduction, $12,000 cost savings, and 90 kWh/year energy reduction.

Decision:
DO NOT UPGRADE - Enable traffic shaping with 143 µs buffer.

Why This Is Safe:
The system flags high-risk scenarios and recommends upgrades when shaping is unsafe. Risk level: NONE.
