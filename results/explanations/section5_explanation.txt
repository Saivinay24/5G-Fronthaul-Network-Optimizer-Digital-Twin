Explanation:
The robustness analysis shows a wide safe operating region from 100 to 200 microseconds—not a fragile sweet spot. Packet loss stays under 1.0% across this entire range. The recommended 143 µs buffer sits well within this safe zone, providing margin for traffic variations.

Decision:
Wide safe range (100-200 µs) ensures robust operation.

Why This Is Safe:
The solution adapts to traffic changes and fails safely by recommending upgrades when operating conditions exceed safe thresholds.
